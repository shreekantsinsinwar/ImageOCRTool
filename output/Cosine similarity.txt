Similarity measure for number sequences

In data analysis, cosine similarity is a 4
measure of similarity between two

non-zero vectors defined in an inner product
space. Cosine similarity is the cosine of the
angle between the vectors; that is, it is the dot
product of the vectors divided by the product of
their lengths. It follows that the cosine similarity
does not depend on the magnitudes of the
vectors, but only on their angle. The cosine
similarity always belongs to the interval

[—1, +1]. For example, two proportional
vectors have a cosine similarity of +1, two
orthogonal vectors have a similarity of 0, and
two opposite vectors have a similarity of -1. In
some contexts, the component values of the
vectors cannot be negative, in which case the

coordinate and a document is represented by
the vector of the numbers of occurrences of
